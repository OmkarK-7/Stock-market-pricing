# Stock-market-pricing

Utilizing over 4000 days of historical stock price data, this project aims to enhance market insights and prediction capabilities through the development of an advanced LSTM model using the Keras library. By capturing the sequential nature of stock data, the model achieves an impressive 86.11% reduction in loss and reaches 99.5% accuracy. With a profound understanding of stock market dynamics and prediction techniques, this project promises to deliver valuable insights into stock price forecasting.
